## Determinants and Effects of Admission to Selective Private Colleges
### Abstract
For this project, we analyzed the impact of admissions policies at Ivy-Plus institutions on socioeconomic diversity among students. Utilizing data from the study by Chetty, Deming, and Friedman, we explored how practices like legacy preferences and athletic recruitment contribute to the overrepresentation of high-income families. Our findings reveal strong correlations between attendance and SAT scores, moderate correlations between application rates and attendance, and low correlations between parental income and educational outcomes. Interestingly, high-income status and SAT-specific application rates do not significantly influence admissions decisions, suggesting that Ivy-Plus admissions may be less economically biased than perceived. This insight encourages a reevaluation of scholarship allocations, outreach programs, and admissions criteria, focusing on broader socioeconomic backgrounds. Admissions offices should invest in holistic review processes that assess an applicant's potential beyond economic capability. Additionally, the unclear impact of SAT and ACT scores implies a shift towards more holistic application aspects, emphasizing comprehensive skill development. Educational institutions should redirect resources from standardized test preparation to developing other competencies. Understanding these dynamics can lead to more equitable educational opportunities, fostering diversity and inclusion in elite institutions and empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions, ultimately contributing to a diverse and competent workforce.
